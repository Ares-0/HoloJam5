Bloom and Gloom platformer
(sorta)
(also not the original b&g platformer idea)

Next
    1 song or a sfx or two (placeholders are fine)
    block out a few stages a day

Bugs etc
    -   Steps to reproduce
        Expected behavior
        Actual behavior
    -   Rare collide with star
        star should cleanse
        star sometimes can be targeted again

    -   Right after respawn arrow takes a few frames to deactivate
            ignoring for jam
    -   Player sprites are washed out from the light
            ignoring for jam
    -   First idle state playes land animation
            ignoring for jam

Player Character
Gloom
    - Right click performs *dash*
        When near a lamp, can right click to dash through the lamp
        Challenge comes from the timing, not over/undershooting it
        Hold right click to launch further (faster?)
    - Left click performs a *tilt*
        Stops all current momentum and does a slight air dodge in a direction for correction
    - When player falls into darkness, they reset
    - When colliding with wall (floor tbd), can tech off with jump to preserve momentum

Stars
Two modes
    Dark (corrupted), still has faint light
    Light (cleaned), bright
Gloom dashes through a lamp to cleanse it
Can have multiple charges
Can have different impulse strengths
Initial main menu is a mostly black screen with some stars
After finishing the game, dolly out to see all the stars are lit up and twinkling

Visuals
Rooms are mostly pitch black
Stars light up area slightly
Make sure to have a distinct boundary line for "nearby a star"
