Player Character
Gloom
Right click performs *dash*
    When near a lamp, can right click to dash through the lamp
    Challenge comes from the timing, not over/undershooting it
    Hold right click to launch further (faster?)

Left click performs a *tilt*
    Stops all current momentum and does a slight air dodge in a direction for correction

When player falls into darkness, they reset


Stars
Two modes
Dark (corrupted), still has faint light
Light (cleaned), bright
Gloom dashes through a lamp to cleanse it
Initial main menu is a mostly black screen with some stars
After finishing the game, dolly out to see all the stars are lit up and twinkling

Visuals
Rooms are mostly pitch black
Stars light up area slightly
Make sure to have a distinct boundary line for "nearby a star"


Rooms
Single room puzzles
Small dark hallway for screen transitions
