Bloom and Gloom platformer
(sorta)
(also not the original b&g platformer idea)

Next
    1 song or a sfx or two (placeholders are fine)
    block out a few stages a day

Bugs etc
    -   Steps to reproduce
        Expected behavior
        Actual behavior
    -   Rare collide with star
        star should cleanse
        star sometimes can be targeted again
    -   Transition from room to room
        Can see stars
        Should be no stars
    -   Air momentum often gets totally killed
        - Potentially fixed by resetting gravity on air enter
    -   Right after respawn arrow takes a few frames to deactivate
    -   Player sprites are washed out from the light

Small todos that aren't bugs
    railgun stars
    stars with different impulses? yes
    have to dash to cleanse star? ???
    bounce momentum?
        When leaving air state, remember final velocity
        if returning to air state in time, restore most of that velocity
    It reaally feels like you should be able to tilt after each dash, but that is too much power

Major todos
    Music
    Menus
    SFX
    Character art
    itch page
    Lighting (ongoing)
    Fine tune character movement (ongoing)

Stretch
    Intro cutscene
    Ending
    Bloom character
    smokey texture on dark stars


Player Character
Gloom
Right click performs *dash*
    When near a lamp, can right click to dash through the lamp
    Challenge comes from the timing, not over/undershooting it
    Hold right click to launch further (faster?)

Left click performs a *tilt*
    Stops all current momentum and does a slight air dodge in a direction for correction

When player falls into darkness, they reset


Stars
Two modes
Dark (corrupted), still has faint light
Light (cleaned), bright
Gloom dashes through a lamp to cleanse it
Initial main menu is a mostly black screen with some stars
After finishing the game, dolly out to see all the stars are lit up and twinkling

Visuals
Rooms are mostly pitch black
Stars light up area slightly
Make sure to have a distinct boundary line for "nearby a star"

Lighting
    Pitch black

SFX

Animations
    (For left right I think I can just make a right animation then swap the eye colors and mirror the render)
    Run         10-15
    Jump        5-7
    Fall        7
