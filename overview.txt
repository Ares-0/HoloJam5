Bloom and Gloom platformer
(sorta)
(also not the original b&g platformer idea)

Next
    1 song or a sfx or two (placeholders are fine)
    block out a few stages a day

Bugs etc
    -   Steps to reproduce
        Expected behavior
        Actual behavior
    -   Rare collide with star
        star should cleanse
        star sometimes can be targeted again
    -   Transition from room to room
        Can see stars
        Should be no stars
    -   Right after respawn arrow takes a few frames to deactivate
    -   Player sprites are washed out from the light
    -   First idle state playes land animation
    -   Death sound gets played during some normal room changes

Small todos that aren't bugs
    railgun stars
    stars with different impulses? yes
    have to dash to cleanse star? ???
    bounce momentum?
        When leaving air state, remember final velocity
        if returning to air state in time, restore most of that velocity
    It reaally feels like you should be able to tilt after each dash, but that is too much power
    Draw 15 total star scratches
        Make sure they all have leeway to not get cut off

Player Character
Gloom
Right click performs *dash*
    When near a lamp, can right click to dash through the lamp
    Challenge comes from the timing, not over/undershooting it
    Hold right click to launch further (faster?)

Left click performs a *tilt*
    Stops all current momentum and does a slight air dodge in a direction for correction

When player falls into darkness, they reset


Stars
Two modes
Dark (corrupted), still has faint light
Light (cleaned), bright
Gloom dashes through a lamp to cleanse it
Initial main menu is a mostly black screen with some stars
After finishing the game, dolly out to see all the stars are lit up and twinkling

Visuals
Rooms are mostly pitch black
Stars light up area slightly
Make sure to have a distinct boundary line for "nearby a star"
