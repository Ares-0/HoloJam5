Bloom and Gloom platformer
(sorta)
(also not the original b&g platformer idea)


Player Character
Gloom
When near a lamp, can right click to dash through the lamp
thats it

Challenge comes from the timing, not over/undershooting it
Hold right click to launch further (faster?)

When player falls into darkness, they reset


Lamps
Two modes
Dark (corrupted), still has faint light
Light (cleaned), bright
Gloom dashes through a lamp to cleanse it


Visuals
Rooms are mostly pitch black
Lamps light up area slightly


Rooms
Single room puzzles
Small dark hallway for screen transitions
